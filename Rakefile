Guides are taken from the source directory, and the result goes into the
output directory. Assets are stored under files, and copied to output/files as
part of the generation process.

You can generate HTML, Kindle or both formats using the `guides:generate` task.

All of these processes are handled via rake tasks, here's a full list of them:

#{%x[rake -T]}
Some arguments may be passed via environment variables:

  RAILS_VERSION=tag
    If guides are being generated for a specific Rails version set the Git tag
    here, otherwise the current SHA1 is going to be used to generate edge guides.

  ALL=1
    Force generation of all guides.

  ONLY=name
    Useful if you want to generate only one or a set of guides.

    Generate only association_basics.html:
      ONLY=assoc

    Separate many using commas:
      ONLY=assoc,migrations

  GUIDES_LANGUAGE
    Use it when you want to generate translated guides in
    source/<GUIDES_LANGUAGE> folder (such as source/es)

Examples:
  $ rake guides:generate ALL=1 RAILS_VERSION=v5.1.0
  $ rake guides:generate ONLY=migrations
  $ rake guides:generate:kindle
  $ rake guides:generate GUIDES_LANGUAGE=es
HELP
  end

    system('git apply rails.patch')
    system('rake guides:generate:html')
