their autoload paths, explained below. autoloading zeitwerk mode enabled default rails applications running cruby: zeitwerk mode, rails uses zeitwerk internally autoload, reload, eager load. rails instantiates configures dedicated zeitwerk instance that manages project. rails application file names have match constants they define, with directories acting namespaces. example, file app/helpers/users_helper.rb should define usershelper file app/controllers/admin/payments_controller.rb should define admin::paymentscontroller. default, rails configures zeitwerk inflect file names

please, check zeitwerk documentation further details. refer list application directories whose contents autoloaded autoload paths. example, app/models. such directories represent root namespace: object. within autoload path, file names must match constants they define documented here. default, autoload paths application consist subdirectories that exist when application boots ---except assets, javascript, views,--- plus autoload paths engines might depend example, usershelper implemented app/helpers/users_helper.rb, module autoloadable, need (and should write) require call autoload paths automatically pick custom directories under app. example, your application app/presenters, app/services, etc., they added autoload paths. array autoload paths extended mutating config.autoload_paths, config/application.rb, nowadays this discouraged. autoload paths added $load_path default. however, zeitwerk uses absolute file names internally, your application should issue require calls autoloadable files, those directories actually needed there. opt-out with this flag: that speed legit require calls bit, since there less lookups. also, your application uses bootsnap, that saves library from building unnecessary indexes, saves they would need. rails automatically reloads classes modules application files change. more precisely, server running application files have been modified, rails unloads autoloaded constants just before next request processed. that way, application classes modules used during that request going autoloaded, thus picking their current implementation file system. reloading enabled disabled. setting that controls this behavior config.cache_classes, which false default development mode (reloading enabled), true default production mode

file from your server then cache example running rails application example.com have configured mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com, then when request made mycdnsubdomain.fictional- cdn.com/assets/smile.png, will query your server once example.com/assets/smile.png cache request. next request that comes same will cached copy. when serve asset directly request never touches your

returns 404, then your will likely cache page valid cache-control header present. check headers cached properly your using curl. request headers from both your server your verify they same: versus

mais sobre layouts como usá-los posteriormente neste guia. você pode usar opção :layout rails arquivo específico como layout action atual: você também pode dizer rails renderizar nenhum layout: você pode usar opção :location definir cabeçalho http location: rails gerará automaticamente resposta código status http correto maioria casos, isso ok). você pode usar opção :status alterar isso: rails entende códigos númericos status símbolos correspondentes mostrados abaixo. rails formato especificado solicitação :html padrão). você pode mudar isso passando opção :formats símbolo array: template formato especificado existir, será gerado erro actionview::missingtemplate. isso rails procurar variações template mesmo formato. você pode especificar lista variações passando opção :variants símbolo

app/views/layouts mesmo nome base controller. exemplo, renderizar actions classe photoscontroller usam app/views/layouts/photos.html.erb app/views/layouts/photos.builder). houver esse layout específico controller, rails usará app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ouapp/views/layouts/application.builder. houver layout .erb, rails usará layout.builder, houver. rails também fornece várias maneiras atribuir layouts específicos mais precisão controllers actions individuais. você pode substituir convenções layout padrão seus controllers usando declaração layout. exemplo: esta declaração, todas views renderizadas pelo productscontroller usarãoapp/views/layouts/inventário.html.erb como layout. atribuir layout específico toda aplicação, declare layout classeapplicationcontroller: esta declaração, todas views, toda aplicação, usarão app/views/layouts/main.html.erb layout. você pode usar símbolo adiar escolha layout requisição seja processada: agora, usuário atual usuário especial, receberá layout especial visualizar produto. você pode usar método inline, como proc, determinar layout. exemplo, você passar objeto proc, bloco você fornecer proc receberá instância controller, layout possa determinado base solicitação atual: layouts especificados nível controller suportam opções :only e:except. essas opções recebem nome método array nomes métodos correspondem nomes métodos controller: esta declaração, layout product seria usado tudo, menos métodosrss index. declarações layout cascateam hierarquia, declarações layout mais específicas sempre substituem mais gerais.

verá mensagem erro pode renderizar redirecionar ação\" (\"can only render redirect once action\"). embora isso seja irritante, relativamente fácil corrigir. geralmente isso ocorre devido mal-entendido

interrompe execução restante código action show, quando rails chegar final ação, começará renderizar view regular_show gerará erro. solução simples: verifique você apenas chamada render redirect único fluxo código. coisa pode ajudar return. aqui está versão corrigida método: certifique-se usar return return, porque return funcionará devido precedência operador linguagem ruby. observe renderização

normalmente chamados \"partials\" outro dispositivo quebrar processo renderização pedaços menores. partial, você pode mover código renderizar pedaço específico resposta arquivo próprio. renderizar partial como parte view, usa-se método render dentro view: isto inclui conteúdo arquivo chamado _menu.html.erb neste ponto dentro view renderizada. note underscore inicial nome arquivo: partials recebem nomes underscore inicial distingui-los views regulares, mesmo usar esta notação casos mais comuns. isso continua sendo verdade mesmo quando você incluir partial outro diretório: este código puxará partial app/views/shared/_menu. jeito usar partials tratá-los como algo equivalente sub-rotinas: como jeito mover detalhes fora view forma você entenda está acontecendo forma mais fácil. exemplo, você pode view estava assim: aqui, partials _ad_banner.html.erb _footer.html.erb podem conteúdo compartilhado muitas páginas aplicação. você precisa detalhes destas seções quando concentrar atenção página particular. como seções anteriores deste guia, yield ferramenta muito poderosa fazer faxina seus layouts. tenha mente isto ruby puro, então possível usar isto quase qualquer lugar. exemplo, podemos usar yield remover duplicação definições layout formulário vários recursos similares: partial pode usar próprio arquivo, assim como view pode usar layout. exemplo, você pode chamar partial assim: isto procura partial chamado _link_area.html.erb renderiza usando layout _graybar.html.erb. note layouts partials seguem mesma nomenclatura underscore inicial partials comuns, ficam mesmo diretório partial qual pertencem (não diretório principal layouts). note também necessário especificar :partial forma explícita quando passar opções adicionais como :layout. você também pode passar variáveis locais partials, tornando-os ainda mais poderosos flexíveis. exemplo, você pode utilizar esta técnica reduzir duplicação entre páginas edit, enquanto mantém pouco conteúdo distinto: mesmo mesma partial renderizado dentro duas views, helper submit retorna \"create zone\" ação \"update zone\" ação edit. passar variável local partial apenas casos específicos usa-se local_assigns. desta forma possível utilizar partial necessidade declarar todas variáveis locais. toda partial também variável local mesmo nome partial (sem underscore inicial). você pode passar objeto esta variável local opção :object. dentro partial customer, variável customer refere @new_customer partir view superior. você instância model renderizar dentro partial, você pode usar sintaxe reduzida: presumindo variável instância @customer contém instância model customer, isto utilizará _customer.html.erb renderizá-la passará variável local customer dentro partial refere variável instância @customer view superior. partials muito úteis renderizar coleções. quando você passa coleção partial através opção :collection, partial será inserido cada membro coleção: quando partial chamado coleção pluralizada, então instâncias individuais partial acesso membro coleção renderizado variável nomeada base partial. neste caso, partial _product, dentro partial _product, você pode referir product pegar instância renderizada. também sintaxe reduzida isto. presumindo question @products coleção instâncias product, você pode simplesmente escrever isto dentro index.html.erb produzir mesmo resultado: rails determina nome partial utilizar olhando nome model coleção. aliás, você pode criar coleção heterogênea fazer renderização deste jeito, rails escolherá partial apropriado cada membro coleção: neste caso, rails utilizará partials cliente empregado situações apropriadas cada membro coleção. caso coleção esteja vazia, render retornará nil, então deve haver dificuldades fornecer conteúdo alternativo. usar variável local personalizada dentro partial, especifique opção chamada partial: esta mudança, você pode acessar instância coleção @products como variável local item dentro partial. você também pode passar variáveis locais arbitrárias qualquer partial você renderizar opção locals: neste caso, partial terá acesso variável local title valor \"products page\". você também pode especificar segunda partial renderizar entre instâncias partial principal usando opção :spacer_template: rails renderizar partial _product_ruler (sem dados encaminhados ele) entre cada partials

fact using rails generator. after that, list available generators just invoking bin/rails generate: will list generators that come with rails. need detailed description helper generator, example, simply since rails 3.0, generators built thor. thor provides powerful options parsing great manipulating files. instance, let's build generator that creates initializer file named initializer.rb inside config/initializers. first step create file lib/generators/initializer_generator.rb with following content: generator quite simple: inherits from rails::generators::base method definition. when generator invoked, each public method generator executed sequentially order that defined. finally, invoke create_file method that will create file given destination with given content. familiar with rails application templates api, you'll feel right home with generators api. invoke generator, just need before let's brand generator description: rails usually able generate good descriptions generator namespaced, activerecord::generators::modelgenerator, this particular case. solve this problem ways. first calling desc inside generator: description invoking --help generator. second description creating file named usage same directory generator. going that next step. generators themselves have generator: this generator just created: first, notice that inheriting from rails::generators::namedbase instead rails::generators::base. this means that generator expects least argument, which will name initializer, will available code variable name. that invoking description this generator (don't forget delete generator file): also that generator class method called source_root. this method points where generator templates will placed, any, default points created directory lib/generators/initializer/templates. order understand what generator template means, let's create file lib/generators/initializer/templates/initializer.rb with following content: let's change generator copy this template when invoked: let's execute generator: that initializer named core_extensions created config/initializers/core_extensions.rb with contents template. that means that copy_file copied file source root destination path gave. method file_name automatically created when inherit from rails::generators::namedbase. methods that available generators covered final section this guide. when bin/rails generate initializer core_extensions rails requires these files turn until found: none found error message. rails generators flexible enough customize scaffolding. they configured config/application.rb, these some defaults: before customize workflow, let's first what scaffold looks like: looking this output, it's easy understand generators work rails above. scaffold generator doesn't actually generate anything, just invokes others work. this allows add/replace/remove those invocations. instance, scaffold generator invokes scaffold_controller generator, which invokes erb, test_unit helper generators. since each generator single responsibility, they easy reuse, avoiding code duplication. want avoid generating default app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.scss file when scaffolding resource disable scaffold_stylesheet: next customization workflow will stop generating stylesheet test fixture files scaffolds altogether. achieve that changing configuration following: generate another resource with scaffold generator, that stylesheet, javascript, fixture files created anymore. want customize further, example datamapper rspec instead active record testunit, it's just matter adding their gems your application configuring your generators. demonstrate this, going create helper generator that simply adds some instance variable readers. first, create generator within rails namespace, this where rails searches generators used hooks: after that, delete both templates directory source_root class method call from generator, because going need them. method below, generator looks like following: generator creating helper products: will generate following helper file app/helpers: which what expected. tell scaffold helper generator editing config/application.rb once again: action when invoking generator: notice output that helper invoked instead rails default. however thing missing, which tests generator that, going reuse helpers test generators. since rails 3.0, this easy hooks concept. helper does need focused specific test framework, simply provide hook test framework just needs implement this hook order compatible. that, change generator this way: now, when helper generator invoked testunit configured test framework, will invoke both rails::testunitgenerator testunit::myhelpergenerator. since none those defined, tell generator invoke testunit::generators::helpergenerator instead, which defined since it's rails generator. that, just need add: re-run scaffold another resource generating tests well! step above simply wanted line generated helper, without adding extra functionality. there simpler that, it's replacing templates already existing generators, that case rails::generators::helpergenerator. rails above, generators don't just look source root templates, they also search templates other paths. them lib/templates. since want customize rails::generators::helpergenerator, that simply making template copy inside lib/templates/rails/helper with name helper.rb. let's create that file with following content: revert last change config/application.rb: generate another resource, that exactly same result! this useful want customize your scaffold templates and/or layout just creating edit.html.erb, index.html.erb inside lib/templates/erb/scaffold. scaffold templates rails frequently tags; these tags need escaped that generated output valid code. example, following escaped would needed template (note extra %)... ...to generate following output: last feature about generators which quite useful plugin generators fallbacks. example, imagine that want feature testunit like shoulda does. since testunit already implements generators required rails shoulda just wants overwrite part there need shoulda reimplement some generators again, simply tell rails testunit generator none found under shoulda namespace. easily simulate this behavior changing config/application.rb once again: now, create comment scaffold, will that shoulda generators being invoked, end, they just falling back testunit generators: fallbacks allow your generators have single responsibility, increasing code reuse reducing amount duplication. that you've seen generators used inside application, know they also used generate applications too? this kind generator referred \"template\". this brief overview templates api. detailed documentation rails application templates guide. above template specify that application relies rspec-rails cucumber-rails these will added test group gemfile. then pose question user about whether they would like install devise. user replies \"yes\" this question, then template will devise gemfile outside group then runs devise:install generator. this template then takes users input runs devise generator, with user's answer from last question being passed this generator. imagine that this template file called template.rb. modify outcome rails command using option passing filename: this command will generate thud application, then apply template generated output. templates don't have stored local system, option also supports online templates: whilst final section this guide doesn't cover generate most awesome template known man, will take through methods available your disposal that develop yourself. these same methods also available generators. rails generators easily modified accept custom command line arguments. this functionality comes from thor: generator

defining internal api. however, public follows slightly different convention. instead assuming public methods designed user consumption, rails uses :nodoc: directive annotate these kinds methods internal api. this means that there methods rails with public visibility that aren't meant user consumption. example this activerecord::core::classmethods#arel_table: thought, \"this method looks like public class method activerecord::core\", were right. actually rails team doesn't want users rely this method. they mark :nodoc: it's removed from public documentation. reasoning behind this allow team change these methods according their internal needs across releases they fit. name this method could change, return value, this entire class disappear; there's guarantee shouldn't depend this your plugins applications. otherwise, risk your breaking when upgrade newer release rails. contributor, it's important think about whether this meant end-user consumption. rails team committed making breaking changes public across releases without going through full deprecation cycle. it's recommended that :nodoc: your internal methods/classes unless they're already private (meaning visibility), which case it's internal default. once stabilizes visibility change, changing public much harder backwards compatibility. class module marked with :nodoc: indicate that methods internal should never used directly. summarize, rails team uses :nodoc: mark publicly visible methods classes internal use; changes visibility should considered carefully discussed over pull request first. when documenting parts rails api, it's important remember pieces that into rails stack. this means that behavior change depending scope context method class you're trying document. various places there different behavior when take entire stack into account, such example actionview::helpers::assettaghelper#image_tag: although default behavior #image_tag always return /images/icon.png, take into account full rails stack (including asset pipeline) result seen above. we're only concerned with behavior experienced when using full default rails stack. this case, want document behavior framework, just this

following features supported: following features (yet) supported: while rails tries most work there still some steps you'll need your application ready multiple databases. let's have application with single writer database need database some tables we're adding. name database will \"animals\". database.yml looks like this: let's replica first configuration, second database called animals replica that well. this need change database.yml from 2-tier 3-tier config. primary configuration provided this will used \"default\" configuration. there configuration named \"primary\" rails will first configuration environment. default configurations will default rails filenames. example primary configurations will schema.rb schema file whereas other entries will [configuration_namespace]_schema.rb filename. when using multiple databases there important settings. first, database name primary primary_replica should same because they contain same data. this also case animals animals_replica. second, username writers replicas should different, replica user's permissions should only read write. when using replica database need replica: true entry replica database.yml. this because rails otherwise knowing which replica which writer. lastly, writer databases need migrations_paths directory where will store migrations that database. we'll look more migrations_paths later this guide. that have database, let's connection model. order database need create abstract class connect animals databases. then need update applicationrecord aware replica. classes that connect primary/primary_replica inherit from applicationrecord like standard rails applications: default rails expects database roles writing reading primary replica respectively. have legacy system already have roles that don't want change. that case role name your application config. it's important connect your database single model then inherit from that model tables rather than connect multiple individual models same database. database clients have limit number open connections there this will multiply number connections have since rails uses model class name connection specification name. that have database.yml model it's time create databases. rails ships with rails tasks need multiple databases rails. bin/rails commands you're able run. should following: running command like bin/rails db:create will create both primary animals databases. note that there command creating users you'll need that manually support readonly users your replicas. want create just animals database bin/rails db:create:animals. migrations multiple databases should live their folders prefixed with name database configuration. also need migrations_paths database configurations tell rails where find migrations. example animals database would look migrations db/animals_migrate directory primary would look db/migrate. rails generators take --database option that file generated correct directory. command like using rails generators, scaffold model generators will create abstract class you. simply pass database command line class with database name record will created. this example database animals with animalsrecord: generated model will automatically inherit from animalsrecord. note: since rails doesn't know which database replica your writer will need this abstract class after you're done. rails will only generate class once. will overwritten scaffolds deleted scaffold deleted. already have abstract class name differs from animalsrecord pass --parent option indicate want different abstract class: this will skip generating animalsrecord since you've indicated rails that want different parent class. finally, order read-only replica your application you'll need activate middleware automatic switching. automatic switching allows application switch from writer replica replica writer based http verb whether there recent write. application receiving post, put, delete, patch request application will automatically write writer database. specified time after write, application will read from primary. head request application will read from replica unless there recent write. activate automatic connection switching middleware, uncomment following lines your application config. rails guarantees \"read your write\" will send your head request writer it's within delay window. default delay seconds. should change this based your database infrastructure. rails doesn't guarantee \"read recent write\" other users within delay window will send head requests replicas unless they wrote recently. automatic connection switching rails relatively primitive deliberately doesn't whole lot. goal system that demonstrates automatic connection switching that flexible enough customizable developers. setup rails allows easily change switching done what parameters it's based let's want cookie instead session decide when swap connections. write your class: then pass middleware: there some cases where want your application connect writer replica automatic connection switching isn't adequate. example, know that particular request always want send request replica, even when post request path. this rails provides connected_to method that will switch connection need. \"role\" connected_to call looks connections that connected that connection handler role). reading connection handler will hold connections that were connected connects_to with role name reading. note that connected_to with role will look existing connection switch using connection specification name. this means that pass unknown role like connected_to(role: :nonexistent) will error that says activerecord::connectionnotestablished connection pool 'activerecord::base' found 'nonexistent' role.) horizontal sharding when split your database reduce number rows each database server, maintain same schema across \"shards\". this commonly called \"multi-tenant\" sharding. supporting horizontal sharding rails similar multiple database vertical sharding that's existed since rails 6.0. shards declared three-tier config like this: models then connected with connects_to shards key: then models swap connections manually connected_to api. using sharding both role shard must passed: horizontal sharding also supports read replicas. swap role shard with connected_to api. rails it's possible switch connections database instead databases globally. this feature must first config.active_record.legacy_connection_handling false your application configuration. majority applications should need make other changes since public apis have same behavior. with legacy_connection_handling false, abstract connection class will able switch connections without affecting other connections. this useful switching your animalsrecord queries read from replica while ensuring your applicationrecord queries primary. it's also possible swap connections granularly shards. switch only primary database

applications need zeitwerk directly. rails sets things according existing contract: config.autoload_paths, config.cache_classes, etc. while applications should stick that interface, actual zeitwerk loader object accessed that handy need preload stis configure custom inflector, example. application being upgraded autoloads correctly, project structure should already mostly compatible. however, classic mode infers file names from missing constant names (underscore), whereas zeitwerk mode infers constant names from file names (camelize). these helpers always inverse each other, particular acronyms involved. instance, \"foo\".underscore \"foo\", \"foo\".camelize \"foo\", \"foo\". compatibility checked with zeitwerk:check task: known cases require_dependency have been eliminated, should grep project delete them. your application stis, please check their section guide autoloading reloading constants (zeitwerk mode). robustly constant paths class module definitions: gotcha aware that, depending order execution, classic autoloader could sometimes able autoload foo::wadus that does match ruby semantics because nesting, won't work zeitwerk mode. find such corner case qualified name foo::wadus: nesting: autoload eager load from standard structure like that case, app/models/concerns assumed root directory (because belongs autoload paths), ignored namespace. app/models/concerns/foo.rb should define foo, concerns::foo. concerns:: namespace worked with classic autoloader side-effect implementation, really intended behavior. application using concerns:: needs rename those classes modules able zeitwerk mode. some projects want something like app/api/base.rb define api::base, autoload paths accomplish that classic mode. since rails adds subdirectories autoload paths automatically, have another situation which there nested root directories, that setup longer works. similar principle explained above with concerns. want keep that structure, you'll need delete subdirectory from autoload paths initializer: namespace defined file, hotel here: hotel constant using class module keywords. example: good. alternatives like  won't work, child objects like hotel::pricing won't found. this restriction only applies explicit namespaces. classes modules defining namespace defined using those idioms. classic mode could technically define several constants same top-level have them reloaded. example, given while could autoloaded, autoloading would mark autoloaded too. this case zeitwerk mode, need move file bar.rb. file, constant. this affects only constants same top-level example above. inner classes modules fine. example, consider application reloads foo, will reload foo::innerclass too. spring reloads application code something changes. test environment need enable reloading that work: otherwise you'll this error: bootsnap should least version 1.4.2. addition that, bootsnap needs disable iseq cache interpreter running ruby 2.5. please make sure depend least bootsnap 1.4.4 that case. configuration point true default backwards compatibility, allows opt-out from adding autoload paths $load_path. this makes sense most applications, since never should require file app/models, example, zeitwerk only uses absolute file names internally. opting-out optimize $load_path lookups (less directories check), save bootsnap work memory consumption, since does need build index these directories. classic mode, constant autoloading thread-safe, though rails locks place example make requests thread-safe when autoloading enabled, common development environment. constant autoloading thread-safe zeitwerk mode. example, autoload multi-threaded scripts executed runner command. beware configurations like every element config.autoload_paths should represent top-level namespace (object) they cannot nested consequence (with exception concerns directories explained above). this, just remove wildcards: classic mode, app/models/foo.rb defines bar, won't able autoload that file, eager loading will work because loads files recursively blindly. this source errors test things first eager loading, execution fail later

link_to(books_url(locale: i18n.locale)), would tedious probably impossible, course. rails contains infrastructure \"centralizing dynamic decisions about urls\" applicationcontroller#default_url_options, which useful precisely this scenario: enables \"defaults\" url_for helper methods dependent implementing/overriding default_url_options). include something like this applicationcontroller then: every helper method dependent url_for (e.g. helpers named routes like root_path root_url, resource routes like books_path books_url, etc.) will automatically include locale query string, like this: http://localhost:3001/?locale=ja. satisfied with this. does impact readability urls, though, when locale \"hangs\" every your application. moreover, from architectural standpoint, locale usually hierarchically above other parts application domain: urls should reflect this. probably want urls look like this: http://www.example.com/en/books (which loads english locale) http://www.example.com/nl/books (which loads dutch locale). this achievable with \"over-riding default_url_options\" strategy from above: just have your routes with scope: now, when call books_path method should \"/en/books\" (for default locale). like http://localhost:3001/nl/books should load dutch locale, then, following calls books_path should return \"/nl/books\" (because locale changed). don't want force locale your routes optional path scope (denoted parentheses) like with this approach will routing error when accessing your resources such http://localhost:3001/books without locale. this useful when want default locale when specified. course, need take special care root (usually \"homepage\" \"dashboard\") your application. like http://localhost:3001/nl will work automatically, because root \"dashboard#index\" declaration your routes.rb doesn't take locale into account. (and rightly there's only \"root\" url.) would probably need urls like these: take special care about order your routes, this route declaration does \"eat\" other ones. (you want directly before root declaration.) application with authenticated users allow users locale preference through application's interface. with this approach, user's selected locale preference persisted database used locale authenticated requests that user. when explicit locale been request (e.g. above methods), application should attempt infer desired locale. accept-language http header indicates preferred language request's response. browsers this header value based user's language preference settings, making good first choice when inferring locale. trivial implementation using accept-language header would practice, more robust code necessary this reliably. iain hecker's http_accept_language library ryan tomayko's locale rack middleware provide solutions this problem. address client making request used infer client's region thus their locale. services such geoip lite country gems like geocoder used implement this approach. general, this approach less reliable than using language header recommended most applications. you've initialized i18n support your ruby rails application told which locale preserve between requests. next need internationalize application abstracting every locale-specific element. finally, need localize providing necessary translations these abstracts. given following example: "},{"id":1226,"title":"API de Internacionalização do Rails (I18n)","heading":"3 Internationalization and Localization","subheading":"3.1 Abstracting Localized Code","content":"there strings code that english that users will rendered response (\"hello flash\" \"hello world\"). order internationalize this code, these strings need replaced calls rails' helper with appropriate each string: now, when this view rendered, will show error message which tells that translations keys :hello_world :hello_flash missing.
