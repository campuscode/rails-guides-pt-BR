Associações Active Record
==========================

Esse guia cobre os recursos de associação do _Active Record_.

Após ler esse guia, você saberá:

* Como declarar associações entre _models_ do _Active Record_.
* Como entender os vários tipos de associações _Active Record_.
* Como usar os métodos adicionados em seus _models_ ao criar associações.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Por Que Associações?
-----------------

Em Rails, uma _associação_ é uma conexão entre dois _models_ em _Active Record_.
Por que precisamos de associações entre _models_? Porque eles tornam as operações
comuns mais simples e fáceis de entender em seu código. Por exemplo, considere
uma aplicação Rails simples que inclua um _model_ para autores e um _model_ para
livros. Cada autor pode ter vários livros. Sem associações, as declarações do
_model_ seriam assim:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
end
```

Agora, suponha que queremos adicionar um novo livro para um autor existente.
Nós precisaríamos fazer algo assim:

```ruby
@book = Book.create(published_at: Time.now, author_id: @author.id)
```

Ou considere excluir um autor, garantindo que todos os seus livros serão
excluídos também:

```ruby
@books = Book.where(author_id: @author.id)
@books.each do |book|
  book.destroy
end
@author.destroy
```

Com as associações do _Active Record_, podemos otimizar essas - e outras -
operações declarando ao Rails que há uma conexão entre os dois _models_. Aqui
está o código revisado para configurar autores e livros:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, dependent: :destroy
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
```

Com essa alteração, é mais fácil criar um novo livro para um autor específico:

```ruby
@book = @author.books.create(published_at: Time.now)
```

Excluir um autor e todos os seus livros é **muito** mais fácil:

```ruby
@author.destroy
```

Para saber mais sobre os diferentes tipos de associações, leia a próxima seção
deste guia. Em seguida há algumas dicas e truques para trabalhar com associações
e, na sequência, uma referência completa dos métodos e opções para associações no
Rails.

Os Tipos de Associações
-------------------------

O Rails suporta seis tipos de associações:

* `belongs_to`
* `has_one`
* `has_many`
* `has_many :through`
* `has_one :through`
* `has_and_belongs_to_many`

As associações são implementadas usando chamadas _macro-style_, para que você possa adicionar declarativamente recursos aos seus _models_. Por exemplo, ao declarar que um _model_ `belongs_to` (pertence a outro), você instrui o Rails a manter as informações de [Primary Key](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chave_prim%C3%A1ria)-[Foreign Key](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chave_estrangeira) (Chave primária-Chave Estrangeira) entre instâncias dos dois _models_, e também obtém vários métodos úteis adicionados ao seu _model_.

No restante deste guia, você aprenderá como declarar e usar as várias formas de associação. Mas primeiro, uma rápida introdução para as situações em que cada tipo de associação é apropriada.

### A Associação `belongs_to`

Uma associação `belongs_to` configura uma conexão um-para-um com outro _model_, de modo que cada instância do _model_ declarante "pertença a" uma instância do outro _model_. Por exemplo, se sua aplicação incluir autores e livros, e cada livro pertencer a apenas um autor, você declarará o _model_ do livro da seguinte maneira:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
```

![Diagrama de Associação belongs_to](images/association_basics/belongs_to.png)

NOTE: as associações `belongs_to` _devem_ usar o termo no singular. Se você usou o plural no exemplo acima para a associação `autor` no _model_ `Livro` e tentou criar a instância com `Book.create(authors: @author)`, você seria informado de que existe uma "constante não inicializada `Book::Authors`". Isso ocorre porque o Rails deduz automaticamente o nome da classe a partir do nome da associação. Se o nome da associação estiver incorretamente no plural, a classe inferida também estará incorreta.

A _migration_ correpondente parecerá assim:

```ruby
class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :authors do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :books do |t|
      t.belongs_to :author
      t.datetime :published_at
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

### A associação `has_one`

Uma associação `has_one` também estabelece uma conexão um-para-um com outro _model_, mas com semânticas um pouco diferentes (e consequências). Essa associação indica que cada instância de um _model_ contém ou possui uma instância de outro _model_. Por exemplo, se cada fornecedor em sua aplicação possuir apenas uma conta, você vai declarar o _model_ de fornecedor da seguinte maneira:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account
end
```

![Diagrama de Associação has_one](images/association_basics/has_one.png)

A _migration_ correpondente parecerá assim:

```ruby
class CreateSuppliers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :suppliers do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :accounts do |t|
      t.belongs_to :supplier
      t.string :account_number
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Dependendo do caso de uso, também pode ser necessário criar um índice exclusivo e/ou
uma restrição de _foreign key_ na coluna do fornecedor para a tabela de contas. Nesse
caso, a definição da coluna parecerá assim:

```ruby
create_table :accounts do |t|
  t.belongs_to :supplier, index: { unique: true }, foreign_key: true
  # ...
end
```

### A Associação `has_many`

Uma associação `has_many` indica uma conexão um-para-muitos com outro _model_. Você encontrará frequentemente essa associação no "outro lado" de uma associação `belongs_to`. Essa associação indica que cada instância do _model_ possui zero ou mais instâncias de outro _model_. Por exemplo, em uma aplicação que contém autores e livros, o _model_ do autor pode ser declarado assim:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```

NOTE: O nome do outro _model_ é pluralizado ao declarar uma associação `has_many`.

![Diagrama de Assocação has_many](images/association_basics/has_many.png)

A _migration_ correpondente parecerá assim:

```ruby
class CreateAuthors < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :authors do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :books do |t|
      t.belongs_to :author
      t.datetime :published_at
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

### A Associação `has_many :through`

Uma associação `has_many :through` é frequentemente usada para estabelecer uma conexão muitos-para-muitos com outro _model_. Essa associação indica que o _model_ declarado pode ser correspondido com zero ou mais instâncias de outro _model_, prosseguindo através (_through_) de um terceiro _model_. Por exemplo, considere uma prática médica em que os pacientes marcam consultas com médicos. As declarações de associação relevantes podem ter a seguinte aparência:

```ruby
class Physician < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :patients, through: :appointments
end

class Appointment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :physician
  belongs_to :patient
end

class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :physicians, through: :appointments
end
```

![Diagrama de Associação has_many :through](images/association_basics/has_many_through.png)

A _migration_ correspondente parecerá assim:

```ruby
class CreateAppointments < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :physicians do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :patients do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :appointments do |t|
      t.belongs_to :physician
      t.belongs_to :patient
      t.datetime :appointment_date
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

O conjunto da junção dos _models_ pode ser gerenciada através dos [métodos de associação `has_many`](#has-many-association-reference).
Por exemplo, se você atribuir:

```ruby
physician.patients = patients
```

Em seguida, novos _models_ de junção são criados automaticamente para os objetos recém-associados.
Se alguns que existiam anteriormente estão faltando agora, suas linhas de junção são excluídas automaticamente.

WARNING: A exclusão automática de _models_ de junção é direta, nenhum _callback_ de destruição é acionado.

A associação `has_many :through` também é útil para configurar "atalhos" através de associações aninhadas `has_many`. Por exemplo, se um documento possui muitas seções e uma seção com muitos parágrafos, você pode obter uma coleção simples de todos os parágrafos do documento. Você pode configurar dessa maneira:

```ruby
class Document < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :sections
  has_many :paragraphs, through: :sections
end

class Section < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :document
  has_many :paragraphs
end

class Paragraph < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :section
end
```

Com `through: :section` especificado, o Rails agora entenderá:

```ruby
@document.paragraphs
```

### A Associação `has_one :through`

Uma Associação `has_one :through` estabelece uma conexão um-para-um com outro _model_. Essa associação indica
que o _model_ declarante pode ser combinado com uma instância de outro _model_, prosseguindo através(_through_) de um terceiro _model_.
Por exemplo, se cada fornecedor tiver uma conta, e cada conta estiver associada a um histórico da conta, então o
_model_ fornecedor poderia ficar assim:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account
  has_one :account_history, through: :account
end

class Account < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :supplier
  has_one :account_history
end

class AccountHistory < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :account
end
```

![has_one :through Association Diagram](images/association_basics/has_one_through.png)

A _migration_ correpondente parecerá assim:

```ruby
class CreateAccountHistories < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :suppliers do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :accounts do |t|
      t.belongs_to :supplier
      t.string :account_number
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :account_histories do |t|
      t.belongs_to :account
      t.integer :credit_rating
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

### A Associação `has_and_belongs_to_many`

Uma associação `has_and_belongs_to_many` cria uma conexão direta muitos-para-muitos com outro _model_, sem nenhum _model_ intermediário. Por exemplo, se sua aplicação incluir conjuntos e peças, com cada conjunto tendo muitas peças e cada peça aparecendo em muitos conjuntos, você poderá declarar os _model_ desta maneira:

```ruby
class Assembly < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :parts
end

class Part < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies
end
```

![has_and_belongs_to_many Association Diagram](images/association_basics/habtm.png)

A _migration_ correpondente parecerá assim:

```ruby
class CreateAssembliesAndParts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :assemblies do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :parts do |t|
      t.string :part_number
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :assemblies_parts, id: false do |t|
      t.belongs_to :assembly
      t.belongs_to :part
    end
  end
end
```

### Escolhendo entre `belongs_to` and `has_one`

Se você deseja configurar um relacionamento um-para-um entre dois _models_, será necessário adicionar `belongs_to` para um e `has_one` ao outro. Como você sabe qual é qual?

A distinção é onde você coloca a _foreign key_ (ela aparece na tabela para a classe que declara a associação `belongs_to`), mas você deve pensar um pouco no significado real dos dados também. O relacionamento `has_one` diz que um de algo é seu - isto é, que algo aponta para você. Por exemplo, faz mais sentido dizer que um fornecedor possui uma conta do que uma conta possui um fornecedor. Isso sugere que os relacionamentos corretos são assim:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account
end

class Account < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :supplier
end
```

A _migration_ correpondente parecerá assim:

```ruby
class CreateSuppliers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :suppliers do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :accounts do |t|
      t.bigint  :supplier_id
      t.string  :account_number
      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :accounts, :supplier_id
  end
end
```

NOTE: O uso de `t.bigint :supplier_id` torna a nomeação da _foreign key_ óbvia e explícita. Nas versões atuais do Rails, você pode abstrair esses detalhes de implementação usando `t.references :supplier`.

### Escolhendo entre `has_many :through` e `has_and_belongs_to_many`

O Rails oferece duas maneiras diferentes de declarar um relacionamento muitos-para-muitos entre os _models_. A maneira mais simples é usar `has_and_belongs_to_many`, o que permite fazer a associação diretamente:

```ruby
class Assembly < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :parts
end

class Part < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies
end
```

A segunda maneira de declara um relacionamento muitos-para-muito é usar `has_many :through`. Isso faz uma associação de forma indireta, através de um _model_ de junção:

```ruby
class Assembly < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :manifests
  has_many :parts, through: :manifests
end

class Manifest < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :assembly
  belongs_to :part
end

class Part < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :manifests
  has_many :assemblies, through: :manifests
end
```

A regra mais simples é que você deve configurar um relacionamento `has_many :through` se precisar trabalhar com o _models_ de relacionamento como uma entidade independente. Se você não precisar fazer nada com o _model_ de relacionamento, pode ser mais simples configurar um relacionamento `has_and_belongs_to_many` (embora seja necessário lembrar de criar a tabela de junção no banco de dados).

Você deve usar `has_many :through` se precisar de validações, _callbacks_ ou atributos extras no _join model_(modelo de junção).

### Associações Polimórficas

Uma mudança um pouco mais avançada nas associações é a _associação polimórfica_. Com associações polimórficas, um _model_ pode pertencer a mais de um outro _model_, em uma única associação. Por exemplo, você pode ter um _model_ de foto que pertença a um _model_ de funcionário ou a um _model_ de produto. Veja como isso pode ser declarado:

```ruby
class Picture < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :imageable, polymorphic: true
end

class Employee < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :pictures, as: :imageable
end

class Product < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :pictures, as: :imageable
end
```

Você pode pensar em uma declaração polimórfica `belongs_to` como uma configuração de interface que qualquer outro _model_ pode usar. Em uma instância do _model_ `Funcionário`, você pode recuperar uma coleção de fotos: `@employee.pictures`.

Da mesma forma, você pode recuperar `@product.pictures`.

Se você tem uma instância do _model_ `Fotos`, você pode chegar ao seu pai via `@picture.imageable`. Para fazer isso funcionar, você precisa declarar uma coluna de _foreign key_ e uma coluna de tipo no _model_ que declara a interface polimórfica:

```ruby
class CreatePictures < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :pictures do |t|
      t.string  :name
      t.bigint  :imageable_id
      t.string  :imageable_type
      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :pictures, [:imageable_type, :imageable_id]
  end
end
```

Esta _migration_ pode ser simplificada usando a forma de `t.references`:

```ruby
class CreatePictures < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :pictures do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.references :imageable, polymorphic: true
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

![Diagrama de Associação Polimórfica](images/association_basics/polymorphic.png)

### Self Joins

Ao projetar um modelo de dados, algumas vezes você encontrará um _model_ que deve ter uma relação consigo mesmo. Por exemplo, você pode querer armazenar todos os funcionários em um único modelo de banco de dados, mas conseguir rastrear relacionamentos como entre gerente e subordinados. Essa situação pode ser modelada com associações _self-joining_:

```ruby
class Employee < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :subordinates, class_name: "Employee",
                          foreign_key: "manager_id"

  belongs_to :manager, class_name: "Employee", optional: true
end
```

Com esta configuração, você pode recuperar `@employee.subordinates` e `@employee.manager`.

Em suas _migrations_/_schema_, você adicionará uma coluna de referências ao próprio _model_.

```ruby
class CreateEmployees < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :employees do |t|
      t.references :manager
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Tips, Tricks, and Warnings
--------------------------

Here are a few things you should know to make efficient use of Active Record associations in your Rails applications:

* Controlling caching
* Avoiding name collisions
* Updating the schema
* Controlling association scope
* Bi-directional associations

### Controlling Caching

All of the association methods are built around caching, which keeps the result of the most recent query available for further operations. The cache is even shared across methods. For example:

```ruby
author.books                 # retrieves books from the database
author.books.size            # uses the cached copy of books
author.books.empty?          # uses the cached copy of books
```

But what if you want to reload the cache, because data might have been changed by some other part of the application? Just call `reload` on the association:

```ruby
author.books                 # retrieves books from the database
author.books.size            # uses the cached copy of books
author.books.reload.empty?   # discards the cached copy of books
                             # and goes back to the database
```

### Avoiding Name Collisions

You are not free to use just any name for your associations. Because creating an association adds a method with that name to the model, it is a bad idea to give an association a name that is already used for an instance method of `ActiveRecord::Base`. The association method would override the base method and break things. For instance, `attributes` or `connection` are bad names for associations.

### Updating the Schema

Associations are extremely useful, but they are not magic. You are responsible for maintaining your database schema to match your associations. In practice, this means two things, depending on what sort of associations you are creating. For `belongs_to` associations you need to create foreign keys, and for `has_and_belongs_to_many` associations you need to create the appropriate join table.

#### Creating Foreign Keys for `belongs_to` Associations

When you declare a `belongs_to` association, you need to create foreign keys as appropriate. For example, consider this model:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
```

This declaration needs to be backed up by a corresponding foreign key column in the books table. For a brand new table, the migration might look something like this:

```ruby
class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :books do |t|
      t.datetime   :published_at
      t.string     :book_number
      t.references :author
    end
  end
end
```

Whereas for an existing table, it might look like this:

```ruby
class AddAuthorToBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    add_reference :books, :author
  end
end
```

NOTE: If you wish to [enforce referential integrity at the database level](/active_record_migrations.html#foreign-keys), add the `foreign_key: true` option to the ‘reference’ column declarations above.

#### Creating Join Tables for `has_and_belongs_to_many` Associations

If you create a `has_and_belongs_to_many` association, you need to explicitly create the joining table. Unless the name of the join table is explicitly specified by using the `:join_table` option, Active Record creates the name by using the lexical order of the class names. So a join between author and book models will give the default join table name of "authors_books" because "a" outranks "b" in lexical ordering.

WARNING: The precedence between model names is calculated using the `<=>` operator for `String`. This means that if the strings are of different lengths, and the strings are equal when compared up to the shortest length, then the longer string is considered of higher lexical precedence than the shorter one. For example, one would expect the tables "paper_boxes" and "papers" to generate a join table name of "papers_paper_boxes" because of the length of the name "paper_boxes", but it in fact generates a join table name of "paper_boxes_papers" (because the underscore '\_' is lexicographically _less_ than 's' in common encodings).

Whatever the name, you must manually generate the join table with an appropriate migration. For example, consider these associations:

```ruby
class Assembly < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :parts
end

class Part < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies
end
```

These need to be backed up by a migration to create the `assemblies_parts` table. This table should be created without a primary key:

```ruby
class CreateAssembliesPartsJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :assemblies_parts, id: false do |t|
      t.bigint :assembly_id
      t.bigint :part_id
    end

    add_index :assemblies_parts, :assembly_id
    add_index :assemblies_parts, :part_id
  end
end
```

We pass `id: false` to `create_table` because that table does not represent a model. That's required for the association to work properly. If you observe any strange behavior in a `has_and_belongs_to_many` association like mangled model IDs, or exceptions about conflicting IDs, chances are you forgot that bit.

You can also use the method `create_join_table`

```ruby
class CreateAssembliesPartsJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_join_table :assemblies, :parts do |t|
      t.index :assembly_id
      t.index :part_id
    end
  end
end
```

### Controlling Association Scope

By default, associations look for objects only within the current module's scope. This can be important when you declare Active Record models within a module. For example:

```ruby
module MyApplication
  module Business
    class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
      has_one :account
    end

    class Account < ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :supplier
    end
  end
end
```

This will work fine, because both the `Supplier` and the `Account` class are defined within the same scope. But the following will _not_ work, because `Supplier` and `Account` are defined in different scopes:

```ruby
module MyApplication
  module Business
    class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
      has_one :account
    end
  end

  module Billing
    class Account < ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :supplier
    end
  end
end
```

To associate a model with a model in a different namespace, you must specify the complete class name in your association declaration:

```ruby
module MyApplication
  module Business
    class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
      has_one :account,
        class_name: "MyApplication::Billing::Account"
    end
  end

  module Billing
    class Account < ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :supplier,
        class_name: "MyApplication::Business::Supplier"
    end
  end
end
```

### Bi-directional Associations

It's normal for associations to work in two directions, requiring declaration on two different models:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
```

Active Record will attempt to automatically identify that these two models share a bi-directional association based on the association name. In this way, Active Record will only load one copy of the `Author` object, making your application more efficient and preventing inconsistent data:

```ruby
a = Author.first
b = a.books.first
a.first_name == b.author.first_name # => true
a.first_name = 'David'
a.first_name == b.author.first_name # => true
```

Active Record supports automatic identification for most associations with standard names. However, Active Record will not automatically identify bi-directional associations that contain a scope or any of the following options:

* `:through`
* `:foreign_key`

For example, consider the following model declarations:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :writer, class_name: 'Author', foreign_key: 'author_id'
end
```

Active Record will no longer automatically recognize the bi-directional association:

```ruby
a = Author.first
b = a.books.first
a.first_name == b.writer.first_name # => true
a.first_name = 'David'
a.first_name == b.writer.first_name # => false
```

Active Record provides the `:inverse_of` option so you can explicitly declare bi-directional associations:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, inverse_of: 'writer'
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :writer, class_name: 'Author', foreign_key: 'author_id'
end
```

By including the `:inverse_of` option in the `has_many` association declaration, Active Record will now recognize the bi-directional association:

```ruby
a = Author.first
b = a.books.first
a.first_name == b.writer.first_name # => true
a.first_name = 'David'
a.first_name == b.writer.first_name # => true
```

Detailed Association Reference
------------------------------

The following sections give the details of each type of association, including the methods that they add and the options that you can use when declaring an association.

### `belongs_to` Association Reference

The `belongs_to` association creates a one-to-one match with another model. In database terms, this association says that this class contains the foreign key. If the other class contains the foreign key, then you should use `has_one` instead.

#### Methods Added by `belongs_to`

When you declare a `belongs_to` association, the declaring class automatically gains 6 methods related to the association:

* `association`
* `association=(associate)`
* `build_association(attributes = {})`
* `create_association(attributes = {})`
* `create_association!(attributes = {})`
* `reload_association`

In all of these methods, `association` is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument to `belongs_to`. For example, given the declaration:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
```

Each instance of the `Book` model will have these methods:

```ruby
author
author=
build_author
create_author
create_author!
reload_author
```

NOTE: When initializing a new `has_one` or `belongs_to` association you must use the `build_` prefix to build the association, rather than the `association.build` method that would be used for `has_many` or `has_and_belongs_to_many` associations. To create one, use the `create_` prefix.

##### `association`

The `association` method returns the associated object, if any. If no associated object is found, it returns `nil`.

```ruby
@author = @book.author
```

If the associated object has already been retrieved from the database for this object, the cached version will be returned. To override this behavior (and force a database read), call `#reload_association` on the parent object.

```ruby
@author = @book.reload_author
```

##### `association=(associate)`

The `association=` method assigns an associated object to this object. Behind the scenes, this means extracting the primary key from the associated object and setting this object's foreign key to the same value.

```ruby
@book.author = @author
```

##### `build_association(attributes = {})`

The `build_association` method returns a new object of the associated type. This object will be instantiated from the passed attributes, and the link through this object's foreign key will be set, but the associated object will _not_ yet be saved.

```ruby
@author = @book.build_author(author_number: 123,
                                  author_name: "John Doe")
```

##### `create_association(attributes = {})`

The `create_association` method returns a new object of the associated type. This object will be instantiated from the passed attributes, the link through this object's foreign key will be set, and, once it passes all of the validations specified on the associated model, the associated object _will_ be saved.

```ruby
@author = @book.create_author(author_number: 123,
                                   author_name: "John Doe")
```

##### `create_association!(attributes = {})`

Does the same as `create_association` above, but raises `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` if the record is invalid.

#### Options for `belongs_to`

While Rails uses intelligent defaults that will work well in most situations, there may be times when you want to customize the behavior of the `belongs_to` association reference. Such customizations can easily be accomplished by passing options and scope blocks when you create the association. For example, this association uses two such options:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, touch: :books_updated_at,
    counter_cache: true
end
```

The `belongs_to` association supports these options:

* `:autosave`
* `:class_name`
* `:counter_cache`
* `:dependent`
* `:foreign_key`
* `:primary_key`
* `:inverse_of`
* `:polymorphic`
* `:touch`
* `:validate`
* `:optional`

##### `:autosave`

If you set the `:autosave` option to `true`, Rails will save any loaded association members and destroy members that are marked for destruction whenever you save the parent object. Setting `:autosave` to `false` is not the same as not setting the `:autosave` option. If the `:autosave` option is not present, then new associated objects will be saved, but updated associated objects will not be saved.

##### `:class_name`

If the name of the other model cannot be derived from the association name, you can use the `:class_name` option to supply the model name. For example, if a book belongs to an author, but the actual name of the model containing authors is `Patron`, you'd set things up this way:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, class_name: "Patron"
end
```

##### `:counter_cache`

The `:counter_cache` option can be used to make finding the number of belonging objects more efficient. Consider these models:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```

With these declarations, asking for the value of `@author.books.size` requires making a call to the database to perform a `COUNT(*)` query. To avoid this call, you can add a counter cache to the _belonging_ model:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, counter_cache: true
end
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```

With this declaration, Rails will keep the cache value up to date, and then return that value in response to the `size` method.

Although the `:counter_cache` option is specified on the model that includes
the `belongs_to` declaration, the actual column must be added to the
_associated_ (`has_many`) model. In the case above, you would need to add a
column named `books_count` to the `Author` model.

You can override the default column name by specifying a custom column name in
the `counter_cache` declaration instead of `true`. For example, to use
`count_of_books` instead of `books_count`:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, counter_cache: :count_of_books
end
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```

NOTE: You only need to specify the `:counter_cache` option on the `belongs_to`
side of the association.

Counter cache columns are added to the containing model's list of read-only attributes through `attr_readonly`.

##### `:dependent`
If you set the `:dependent` option to:

* `:destroy`, when the object is destroyed, `destroy` will be called on its
  associated objects.
* `:delete`, when the object is destroyed, all its associated objects will be
  deleted directly from the database without calling their `destroy` method.

WARNING: You should not specify this option on a `belongs_to` association that is connected with a `has_many` association on the other class. Doing so can lead to orphaned records in your database.

##### `:foreign_key`

By convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the foreign key on this model is the name of the association with the suffix `_id` added. The `:foreign_key` option lets you set the name of the foreign key directly:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, class_name: "Patron",
                        foreign_key: "patron_id"
end
```

TIP: In any case, Rails will not create foreign key columns for you. You need to explicitly define them as part of your migrations.

##### `:primary_key`

By convention, Rails assumes that the `id` column is used to hold the primary key
of its tables. The `:primary_key` option allows you to specify a different column.

For example, given we have a `users` table with `guid` as the primary key. If we want a separate `todos` table to hold the foreign key `user_id` in the `guid` column, then we can use `primary_key` to achieve this like so:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  self.primary_key = 'guid' # primary key is guid and not id
end

class Todo < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user, primary_key: 'guid'
end
```

When we execute `@user.todos.create` then the `@todo` record will have its
`user_id` value as the `guid` value of `@user`.

##### `:inverse_of`

The `:inverse_of` option specifies the name of the `has_many` or `has_one` association that is the inverse of this association.

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, inverse_of: :author
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, inverse_of: :books
end
```

##### `:polymorphic`

Passing `true` to the `:polymorphic` option indicates that this is a polymorphic association. Polymorphic associations were discussed in detail <a href="#polymorphic-associations">earlier in this guide</a>.

##### `:touch`

If you set the `:touch` option to `true`, then the `updated_at` or `updated_on` timestamp on the associated object will be set to the current time whenever this object is saved or destroyed:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, touch: true
end

class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```

In this case, saving or destroying a book will update the timestamp on the associated author. You can also specify a particular timestamp attribute to update:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, touch: :books_updated_at
end
```

##### `:validate`

If you set the `:validate` option to `true`, then associated objects will be validated whenever you save this object. By default, this is `false`: associated objects will not be validated when this object is saved.

##### `:optional`

If you set the `:optional` option to `true`, then the presence of the associated
object won't be validated. By default, this option is set to `false`.

#### Scopes for `belongs_to`

There may be times when you wish to customize the query used by `belongs_to`. Such customizations can be achieved via a scope block. For example:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, -> { where active: true }
end
```

You can use any of the standard [querying methods](active_record_querying.html) inside the scope block. The following ones are discussed below:

* `where`
* `includes`
* `readonly`
* `select`

##### `where`

The `where` method lets you specify the conditions that the associated object must meet.

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, -> { where active: true }
end
```

##### `includes`

You can use the `includes` method to specify second-order associations that should be eager-loaded when this association is used. For example, consider these models:

```ruby
class Chapter < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :book
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
  has_many :chapters
end

class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```

If you frequently retrieve authors directly from chapters (`@chapter.book.author`), then you can make your code somewhat more efficient by including authors in the association from chapters to books:

```ruby
class Chapter < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :book, -> { includes :author }
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
  has_many :chapters
end

class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```

NOTE: There's no need to use `includes` for immediate associations - that is, if you have `Book belongs_to :author`, then the author is eager-loaded automatically when it's needed.

##### `readonly`

If you use `readonly`, then the associated object will be read-only when retrieved via the association.

##### `select`

The `select` method lets you override the SQL `SELECT` clause that is used to retrieve data about the associated object. By default, Rails retrieves all columns.

TIP: If you use the `select` method on a `belongs_to` association, you should also set the `:foreign_key` option to guarantee the correct results.

#### Do Any Associated Objects Exist?

You can see if any associated objects exist by using the `association.nil?` method:

```ruby
if @book.author.nil?
  @msg = "No author found for this book"
end
```

#### When are Objects Saved?

Assigning an object to a `belongs_to` association does _not_ automatically save the object. It does not save the associated object either.

### `has_one` Association Reference

The `has_one` association creates a one-to-one match with another model. In database terms, this association says that the other class contains the foreign key. If this class contains the foreign key, then you should use `belongs_to` instead.

#### Methods Added by `has_one`

When you declare a `has_one` association, the declaring class automatically gains 6 methods related to the association:

* `association`
* `association=(associate)`
* `build_association(attributes = {})`
* `create_association(attributes = {})`
* `create_association!(attributes = {})`
* `reload_association`

In all of these methods, `association` is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument to `has_one`. For example, given the declaration:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account
end
```

Each instance of the `Supplier` model will have these methods:

```ruby
account
account=
build_account
create_account
create_account!
reload_account
```

NOTE: When initializing a new `has_one` or `belongs_to` association you must use the `build_` prefix to build the association, rather than the `association.build` method that would be used for `has_many` or `has_and_belongs_to_many` associations. To create one, use the `create_` prefix.

##### `association`

The `association` method returns the associated object, if any. If no associated object is found, it returns `nil`.

```ruby
@account = @supplier.account
```

If the associated object has already been retrieved from the database for this object, the cached version will be returned. To override this behavior (and force a database read), call `#reload_association` on the parent object.

```ruby
@account = @supplier.reload_account
```

##### `association=(associate)`

The `association=` method assigns an associated object to this object. Behind the scenes, this means extracting the primary key from this object and setting the associated object's foreign key to the same value.

```ruby
@supplier.account = @account
```

##### `build_association(attributes = {})`

The `build_association` method returns a new object of the associated type. This object will be instantiated from the passed attributes, and the link through its foreign key will be set, but the associated object will _not_ yet be saved.

```ruby
@account = @supplier.build_account(terms: "Net 30")
```

##### `create_association(attributes = {})`

The `create_association` method returns a new object of the associated type. This object will be instantiated from the passed attributes, the link through its foreign key will be set, and, once it passes all of the validations specified on the associated model, the associated object _will_ be saved.

```ruby
@account = @supplier.create_account(terms: "Net 30")
```

##### `create_association!(attributes = {})`

Does the same as `create_association` above, but raises `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` if the record is invalid.

#### Options for `has_one`

While Rails uses intelligent defaults that will work well in most situations, there may be times when you want to customize the behavior of the `has_one` association reference. Such customizations can easily be accomplished by passing options when you create the association. For example, this association uses two such options:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, class_name: "Billing", dependent: :nullify
end
```

The `has_one` association supports these options:

* `:as`
* `:autosave`
* `:class_name`
* `:dependent`
* `:foreign_key`
* `:inverse_of`
* `:primary_key`
* `:source`
* `:source_type`
* `:through`
* `:touch`
* `:validate`

##### `:as`

Setting the `:as` option indicates that this is a polymorphic association. Polymorphic associations were discussed in detail [earlier in this guide](#polymorphic-associations).

##### `:autosave`

If you set the `:autosave` option to `true`, Rails will save any loaded association members and destroy members that are marked for destruction whenever you save the parent object. Setting `:autosave` to `false` is not the same as not setting the `:autosave` option. If the `:autosave` option is not present, then new associated objects will be saved, but updated associated objects will not be saved.

##### `:class_name`

If the name of the other model cannot be derived from the association name, you can use the `:class_name` option to supply the model name. For example, if a supplier has an account, but the actual name of the model containing accounts is `Billing`, you'd set things up this way:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, class_name: "Billing"
end
```

##### `:dependent`

Controls what happens to the associated object when its owner is destroyed:

* `:destroy` causes the associated object to also be destroyed
* `:delete` causes the associated object to be deleted directly from the database (so callbacks will not execute)
* `:nullify` causes the foreign key to be set to `NULL`. Polymorphic type column is also nullified on polymorphic associations. Callbacks are not executed.
* `:restrict_with_exception` causes an `ActiveRecord::DeleteRestrictionError` exception to be raised if there is an associated record
* `:restrict_with_error` causes an error to be added to the owner if there is an associated object

It's necessary not to set or leave `:nullify` option for those associations
that have `NOT NULL` database constraints. If you don't set `dependent` to
destroy such associations you won't be able to change the associated object
because the initial associated object's foreign key will be set to the
unallowed `NULL` value.

##### `:foreign_key`

By convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the foreign key on the other model is the name of this model with the suffix `_id` added. The `:foreign_key` option lets you set the name of the foreign key directly:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, foreign_key: "supp_id"
end
```

TIP: In any case, Rails will not create foreign key columns for you. You need to explicitly define them as part of your migrations.

##### `:inverse_of`

The `:inverse_of` option specifies the name of the `belongs_to` association that is the inverse of this association.

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, inverse_of: :supplier
end

class Account < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :supplier, inverse_of: :account
end
```

##### `:primary_key`

By convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the primary key of this model is `id`. You can override this and explicitly specify the primary key with the `:primary_key` option.

##### `:source`

The `:source` option specifies the source association name for a `has_one :through` association.

##### `:source_type`

The `:source_type` option specifies the source association type for a `has_one :through` association that proceeds through a polymorphic association.

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :format, polymorphic: true
  has_one :dust_jacket, through: :format, source: :dust_jacket, source_type: "Hardback"
end

class Paperback < ApplicationRecord; end

class Hardback < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :dust_jacket
end

class DustJacket < ApplicationRecord; end
```

##### `:through`

The `:through` option specifies a join model through which to perform the query. `has_one :through` associations were discussed in detail [earlier in this guide](#the-has-one-through-association).

##### `:touch`

If you set the `:touch` option to `true`, then the `updated_at` or `updated_on` timestamp on the associated object will be set to the current time whenever this object is saved or destroyed:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, touch: true
end

class Account < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :supplier
end
```

In this case, saving or destroying a supplier will update the timestamp on the associated account. You can also specify a particular timestamp attribute to update:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, touch: :suppliers_updated_at
end
```

##### `:validate`

If you set the `:validate` option to `true`, then associated objects will be validated whenever you save this object. By default, this is `false`: associated objects will not be validated when this object is saved.

#### Scopes for `has_one`

There may be times when you wish to customize the query used by `has_one`. Such customizations can be achieved via a scope block. For example:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, -> { where active: true }
end
```

You can use any of the standard [querying methods](active_record_querying.html) inside the scope block. The following ones are discussed below:

* `where`
* `includes`
* `readonly`
* `select`

##### `where`

The `where` method lets you specify the conditions that the associated object must meet.

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, -> { where "confirmed = 1" }
end
```

##### `includes`

You can use the `includes` method to specify second-order associations that should be eager-loaded when this association is used. For example, consider these models:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account
end

class Account < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :supplier
  belongs_to :representative
end

class Representative < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :accounts
end
```

If you frequently retrieve representatives directly from suppliers (`@supplier.account.representative`), then you can make your code somewhat more efficient by including representatives in the association from suppliers to accounts:

```ruby
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :account, -> { includes :representative }
end

class Account < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :supplier
  belongs_to :representative
end

class Representative < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :accounts
end
```

##### `readonly`

If you use the `readonly` method, then the associated object will be read-only when retrieved via the association.

##### `select`

The `select` method lets you override the SQL `SELECT` clause that is used to retrieve data about the associated object. By default, Rails retrieves all columns.

#### Do Any Associated Objects Exist?

You can see if any associated objects exist by using the `association.nil?` method:

```ruby
if @supplier.account.nil?
  @msg = "No account found for this supplier"
end
```

#### When are Objects Saved?

When you assign an object to a `has_one` association, that object is automatically saved (in order to update its foreign key). In addition, any object being replaced is also automatically saved, because its foreign key will change too.

If either of these saves fails due to validation errors, then the assignment statement returns `false` and the assignment itself is cancelled.

If the parent object (the one declaring the `has_one` association) is unsaved (that is, `new_record?` returns `true`) then the child objects are not saved. They will automatically when the parent object is saved.

If you want to assign an object to a `has_one` association without saving the object, use the `build_association` method.

### `has_many` Association Reference

The `has_many` association creates a one-to-many relationship with another model. In database terms, this association says that the other class will have a foreign key that refers to instances of this class.

#### Methods Added by `has_many`

When you declare a `has_many` association, the declaring class automatically gains 17 methods related to the association:

* `collection`
* `collection<<(object, ...)`
* `collection.delete(object, ...)`
* `collection.destroy(object, ...)`
* `collection=(objects)`
* `collection_singular_ids`
* `collection_singular_ids=(ids)`
* `collection.clear`
* `collection.empty?`
* `collection.size`
* `collection.find(...)`
* `collection.where(...)`
* `collection.exists?(...)`
* `collection.build(attributes = {}, ...)`
* `collection.create(attributes = {})`
* `collection.create!(attributes = {})`
* `collection.reload`

In all of these methods, `collection` is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument to `has_many`, and `collection_singular` is replaced with the singularized version of that symbol. For example, given the declaration:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```

Each instance of the `Author` model will have these methods:

```ruby
books
books<<(object, ...)
books.delete(object, ...)
books.destroy(object, ...)
books=(objects)
book_ids
book_ids=(ids)
books.clear
books.empty?
books.size
books.find(...)
books.where(...)
books.exists?(...)
books.build(attributes = {}, ...)
books.create(attributes = {})
books.create!(attributes = {})
books.reload
```

##### `collection`

The `collection` method returns a Relation of all of the associated objects. If there are no associated objects, it returns an empty Relation.

```ruby
@books = @author.books
```

##### `collection<<(object, ...)`

The `collection<<` method adds one or more objects to the collection by setting their foreign keys to the primary key of the calling model.

```ruby
@author.books << @book1
```

##### `collection.delete(object, ...)`

The `collection.delete` method removes one or more objects from the collection by setting their foreign keys to `NULL`.

```ruby
@author.books.delete(@book1)
```

WARNING: Additionally, objects will be destroyed if they're associated with `dependent: :destroy`, and deleted if they're associated with `dependent: :delete_all`.

##### `collection.destroy(object, ...)`

The `collection.destroy` method removes one or more objects from the collection by running `destroy` on each object.

```ruby
@author.books.destroy(@book1)
```

WARNING: Objects will _always_ be removed from the database, ignoring the `:dependent` option.

##### `collection=(objects)`

The `collection=` method makes the collection contain only the supplied objects, by adding and deleting as appropriate. The changes are persisted to the database.

##### `collection_singular_ids`

The `collection_singular_ids` method returns an array of the ids of the objects in the collection.

```ruby
@book_ids = @author.book_ids
```

##### `collection_singular_ids=(ids)`

The `collection_singular_ids=` method makes the collection contain only the objects identified by the supplied primary key values, by adding and deleting as appropriate. The changes are persisted to the database.

##### `collection.clear`

The `collection.clear` method removes all objects from the collection according to the strategy specified by the `dependent` option. If no option is given, it follows the default strategy. The default strategy for `has_many :through` associations is `delete_all`, and for `has_many` associations is to set the foreign keys to `NULL`.

```ruby
@author.books.clear
```

WARNING: Objects will be deleted if they're associated with `dependent: :destroy`,
just like `dependent: :delete_all`.

##### `collection.empty?`

The `collection.empty?` method returns `true` if the collection does not contain any associated objects.

```erb
<% if @author.books.empty? %>
  No Books Found
<% end %>
```

##### `collection.size`

The `collection.size` method returns the number of objects in the collection.

```ruby
@book_count = @author.books.size
```

##### `collection.find(...)`

The `collection.find` method finds objects within the collection. It uses the same syntax and options as
[`ActiveRecord::Base.find`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FinderMethods.html#method-i-find).

```ruby
@available_book = @author.books.find(1)
```

##### `collection.where(...)`

The `collection.where` method finds objects within the collection based on the conditions supplied but the objects are loaded lazily meaning that the database is queried only when the object(s) are accessed.

```ruby
@available_books = @author.books.where(available: true) # No query yet
@available_book = @available_books.first # Now the database will be queried
```

##### `collection.exists?(...)`

The `collection.exists?` method checks whether an object meeting the supplied
conditions exists in the collection. It uses the same syntax and options as
[`ActiveRecord::Base.exists?`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FinderMethods.html#method-i-exists-3F).

##### `collection.build(attributes = {}, ...)`

The `collection.build` method returns a single or array of new objects of the associated type. The object(s) will be instantiated from the passed attributes, and the link through their foreign key will be created, but the associated objects will _not_ yet be saved.

```ruby
@book = @author.books.build(published_at: Time.now,
                                book_number: "A12345")

@books = @author.books.build([
  { published_at: Time.now, book_number: "A12346" },
  { published_at: Time.now, book_number: "A12347" }
])
```

##### `collection.create(attributes = {})`

The `collection.create` method returns a single or array of new objects of the associated type. The object(s) will be instantiated from the passed attributes, the link through its foreign key will be created, and, once it passes all of the validations specified on the associated model, the associated object _will_ be saved.

```ruby
@book = @author.books.create(published_at: Time.now,
                                 book_number: "A12345")

@books = @author.books.create([
  { published_at: Time.now, book_number: "A12346" },
  { published_at: Time.now, book_number: "A12347" }
])
```

##### `collection.create!(attributes = {})`

Does the same as `collection.create` above, but raises `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` if the record is invalid.

##### `collection.reload`

The `collection.reload` method returns a Relation of all of the associated objects, forcing a database read. If there are no associated objects, it returns an empty Relation.

```ruby
@books = @author.books.reload
```

#### Options for `has_many`

While Rails uses intelligent defaults that will work well in most situations, there may be times when you want to customize the behavior of the `has_many` association reference. Such customizations can easily be accomplished by passing options when you create the association. For example, this association uses two such options:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, dependent: :delete_all, validate: false
end
```

The `has_many` association supports these options:

* `:as`
* `:autosave`
* `:class_name`
* `:counter_cache`
* `:dependent`
* `:foreign_key`
* `:inverse_of`
* `:primary_key`
* `:source`
* `:source_type`
* `:through`
* `:validate`

##### `:as`

Setting the `:as` option indicates that this is a polymorphic association, as discussed [earlier in this guide](#polymorphic-associations).

##### `:autosave`

If you set the `:autosave` option to `true`, Rails will save any loaded association members and destroy members that are marked for destruction whenever you save the parent object. Setting `:autosave` to `false` is not the same as not setting the `:autosave` option. If the `:autosave` option is not present, then new associated objects will be saved, but updated associated objects will not be saved.

##### `:class_name`

If the name of the other model cannot be derived from the association name, you can use the `:class_name` option to supply the model name. For example, if an author has many books, but the actual name of the model containing books is `Transaction`, you'd set things up this way:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, class_name: "Transaction"
end
```

##### `:counter_cache`

This option can be used to configure a custom named `:counter_cache`. You only need this option when you customized the name of your `:counter_cache` on the [belongs_to association](#options-for-belongs-to).

##### `:dependent`

Controls what happens to the associated objects when their owner is destroyed:

* `:destroy` causes all the associated objects to also be destroyed
* `:delete_all` causes all the associated objects to be deleted directly from the database (so callbacks will not execute)
* `:nullify` causes the foreign key to be set to `NULL`. Polymorphic type column is also nullified on polymorphic associations. Callbacks are not executed.
* `:restrict_with_exception` causes an `ActiveRecord::DeleteRestrictionError` exception to be raised if there are any associated records
* `:restrict_with_error` causes an error to be added to the owner if there are any associated objects

The `:destroy` and `:delete_all` options also affect the semantics of the `collection.delete` and `collection=` methods by causing them to destroy associated objects when they are removed from the collection.

##### `:foreign_key`

By convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the foreign key on the other model is the name of this model with the suffix `_id` added. The `:foreign_key` option lets you set the name of the foreign key directly:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, foreign_key: "cust_id"
end
```

TIP: In any case, Rails will not create foreign key columns for you. You need to explicitly define them as part of your migrations.

##### `:inverse_of`

The `:inverse_of` option specifies the name of the `belongs_to` association that is the inverse of this association.

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, inverse_of: :author
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, inverse_of: :books
end
```

##### `:primary_key`

By convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the primary key of the association is `id`. You can override this and explicitly specify the primary key with the `:primary_key` option.

Let's say the `users` table has `id` as the primary_key but it also
has a `guid` column. The requirement is that the `todos` table should
hold the `guid` column value as the foreign key and not `id`
value. This can be achieved like this:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :todos, primary_key: :guid
end
```

Now if we execute `@todo = @user.todos.create` then the `@todo`
record's `user_id` value will be the `guid` value of `@user`.


##### `:source`

The `:source` option specifies the source association name for a `has_many :through` association. You only need to use this option if the name of the source association cannot be automatically inferred from the association name.

##### `:source_type`

The `:source_type` option specifies the source association type for a `has_many :through` association that proceeds through a polymorphic association.

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
  has_many :paperbacks, through: :books, source: :format, source_type: "Paperback"
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :format, polymorphic: true
end

class Hardback < ApplicationRecord; end
class Paperback < ApplicationRecord; end
```

##### `:through`

The `:through` option specifies a join model through which to perform the query. `has_many :through` associations provide a way to implement many-to-many relationships, as discussed [earlier in this guide](#the-has-many-through-association).

##### `:validate`

If you set the `:validate` option to `false`, then associated objects will not be validated whenever you save this object. By default, this is `true`: associated objects will be validated when this object is saved.

#### Scopes for `has_many`

There may be times when you wish to customize the query used by `has_many`. Such customizations can be achieved via a scope block. For example:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, -> { where processed: true }
end
```

You can use any of the standard [querying methods](active_record_querying.html) inside the scope block. The following ones are discussed below:

* `where`
* `extending`
* `group`
* `includes`
* `limit`
* `offset`
* `order`
* `readonly`
* `select`
* `distinct`

##### `where`

The `where` method lets you specify the conditions that the associated object must meet.

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :confirmed_books, -> { where "confirmed = 1" },
    class_name: "Book"
end
```

You can also set conditions via a hash:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :confirmed_books, -> { where confirmed: true },
                              class_name: "Book"
end
```

If you use a hash-style `where` option, then record creation via this association will be automatically scoped using the hash. In this case, using `@author.confirmed_books.create` or `@author.confirmed_books.build` will create books where the confirmed column has the value `true`.

##### `extending`

The `extending` method specifies a named module to extend the association proxy. Association extensions are discussed in detail [later in this guide](#association-extensions).

##### `group`

The `group` method supplies an attribute name to group the result set by, using a `GROUP BY` clause in the finder SQL.

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :chapters, -> { group 'books.id' },
                      through: :books
end
```

##### `includes`

You can use the `includes` method to specify second-order associations that should be eager-loaded when this association is used. For example, consider these models:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
  has_many :chapters
end

class Chapter < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :book
end
```

If you frequently retrieve chapters directly from authors (`@author.books.chapters`), then you can make your code somewhat more efficient by including chapters in the association from authors to books:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, -> { includes :chapters }
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
  has_many :chapters
end

class Chapter < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :book
end
```

##### `limit`

The `limit` method lets you restrict the total number of objects that will be fetched through an association.

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :recent_books,
    -> { order('published_at desc').limit(100) },
    class_name: "Book"
end
```

##### `offset`

The `offset` method lets you specify the starting offset for fetching objects via an association. For example, `-> { offset(11) }` will skip the first 11 records.

##### `order`

The `order` method dictates the order in which associated objects will be received (in the syntax used by an SQL `ORDER BY` clause).

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, -> { order "date_confirmed DESC" }
end
```

##### `readonly`

If you use the `readonly` method, then the associated objects will be read-only when retrieved via the association.

##### `select`

The `select` method lets you override the SQL `SELECT` clause that is used to retrieve data about the associated objects. By default, Rails retrieves all columns.

WARNING: If you specify your own `select`, be sure to include the primary key and foreign key columns of the associated model. If you do not, Rails will throw an error.

##### `distinct`

Use the `distinct` method to keep the collection free of duplicates. This is
mostly useful together with the `:through` option.

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :readings
  has_many :articles, through: :readings
end

person = Person.create(name: 'John')
article   = Article.create(name: 'a1')
person.articles << article
person.articles << article
person.articles.inspect # => [#<Article id: 5, name: "a1">, #<Article id: 5, name: "a1">]
Reading.all.inspect     # => [#<Reading id: 12, person_id: 5, article_id: 5>, #<Reading id: 13, person_id: 5, article_id: 5>]
```

In the above case there are two readings and `person.articles` brings out both of
them even though these records are pointing to the same article.

Now let's set `distinct`:

```ruby
class Person
  has_many :readings
  has_many :articles, -> { distinct }, through: :readings
end

person = Person.create(name: 'Honda')
article   = Article.create(name: 'a1')
person.articles << article
person.articles << article
person.articles.inspect # => [#<Article id: 7, name: "a1">]
Reading.all.inspect     # => [#<Reading id: 16, person_id: 7, article_id: 7>, #<Reading id: 17, person_id: 7, article_id: 7>]
```

In the above case there are still two readings. However `person.articles` shows
only one article because the collection loads only unique records.

If you want to make sure that, upon insertion, all of the records in the
persisted association are distinct (so that you can be sure that when you
inspect the association that you will never find duplicate records), you should
add a unique index on the table itself. For example, if you have a table named
`readings` and you want to make sure the articles can only be added to a person once,
you could add the following in a migration:

```ruby
add_index :readings, [:person_id, :article_id], unique: true
```

Once you have this unique index, attempting to add the article to a person twice
will raise an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique` error:

```ruby
person = Person.create(name: 'Honda')
article = Article.create(name: 'a1')
person.articles << article
person.articles << article # => ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique
```

Note that checking for uniqueness using something like `include?` is subject
to race conditions. Do not attempt to use `include?` to enforce distinctness
in an association. For instance, using the article example from above, the
following code would be racy because multiple users could be attempting this
at the same time:

```ruby
person.articles << article unless person.articles.include?(article)
```

#### When are Objects Saved?

When you assign an object to a `has_many` association, that object is automatically saved (in order to update its foreign key). If you assign multiple objects in one statement, then they are all saved.

If any of these saves fails due to validation errors, then the assignment statement returns `false` and the assignment itself is cancelled.

If the parent object (the one declaring the `has_many` association) is unsaved (that is, `new_record?` returns `true`) then the child objects are not saved when they are added. All unsaved members of the association will automatically be saved when the parent is saved.

If you want to assign an object to a `has_many` association without saving the object, use the `collection.build` method.

### `has_and_belongs_to_many` Association Reference

The `has_and_belongs_to_many` association creates a many-to-many relationship with another model. In database terms, this associates two classes via an intermediate join table that includes foreign keys referring to each of the classes.

#### Methods Added by `has_and_belongs_to_many`

When you declare a `has_and_belongs_to_many` association, the declaring class automatically gains 17 methods related to the association:

* `collection`
* `collection<<(object, ...)`
* `collection.delete(object, ...)`
* `collection.destroy(object, ...)`
* `collection=(objects)`
* `collection_singular_ids`
* `collection_singular_ids=(ids)`
* `collection.clear`
* `collection.empty?`
* `collection.size`
* `collection.find(...)`
* `collection.where(...)`
* `collection.exists?(...)`
* `collection.build(attributes = {})`
* `collection.create(attributes = {})`
* `collection.create!(attributes = {})`
* `collection.reload`

In all of these methods, `collection` is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument to `has_and_belongs_to_many`, and `collection_singular` is replaced with the singularized version of that symbol. For example, given the declaration:

```ruby
class Part < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies
end
```

Each instance of the `Part` model will have these methods:

```ruby
assemblies
assemblies<<(object, ...)
assemblies.delete(object, ...)
assemblies.destroy(object, ...)
assemblies=(objects)
assembly_ids
assembly_ids=(ids)
assemblies.clear
assemblies.empty?
assemblies.size
assemblies.find(...)
assemblies.where(...)
assemblies.exists?(...)
assemblies.build(attributes = {}, ...)
assemblies.create(attributes = {})
assemblies.create!(attributes = {})
assemblies.reload
```

##### Additional Column Methods

If the join table for a `has_and_belongs_to_many` association has additional columns beyond the two foreign keys, these columns will be added as attributes to records retrieved via that association. Records returned with additional attributes will always be read-only, because Rails cannot save changes to those attributes.

WARNING: The use of extra attributes on the join table in a `has_and_belongs_to_many` association is deprecated. If you require this sort of complex behavior on the table that joins two models in a many-to-many relationship, you should use a `has_many :through` association instead of `has_and_belongs_to_many`.


##### `collection`

The `collection` method returns a Relation of all of the associated objects. If there are no associated objects, it returns an empty Relation.

```ruby
@assemblies = @part.assemblies
```

##### `collection<<(object, ...)`

The `collection<<` method adds one or more objects to the collection by creating records in the join table.

```ruby
@part.assemblies << @assembly1
```

NOTE: This method is aliased as `collection.concat` and `collection.push`.

##### `collection.delete(object, ...)`

The `collection.delete` method removes one or more objects from the collection by deleting records in the join table. This does not destroy the objects.

```ruby
@part.assemblies.delete(@assembly1)
```

##### `collection.destroy(object, ...)`

The `collection.destroy` method removes one or more objects from the collection by deleting records in the join table. This does not destroy the objects.

```ruby
@part.assemblies.destroy(@assembly1)
```

##### `collection=(objects)`

The `collection=` method makes the collection contain only the supplied objects, by adding and deleting as appropriate. The changes are persisted to the database.

##### `collection_singular_ids`

The `collection_singular_ids` method returns an array of the ids of the objects in the collection.

```ruby
@assembly_ids = @part.assembly_ids
```

##### `collection_singular_ids=(ids)`

The `collection_singular_ids=` method makes the collection contain only the objects identified by the supplied primary key values, by adding and deleting as appropriate. The changes are persisted to the database.

##### `collection.clear`

The `collection.clear` method removes every object from the collection by deleting the rows from the joining table. This does not destroy the associated objects.

##### `collection.empty?`

The `collection.empty?` method returns `true` if the collection does not contain any associated objects.

```ruby
<% if @part.assemblies.empty? %>
  This part is not used in any assemblies
<% end %>
```

##### `collection.size`

The `collection.size` method returns the number of objects in the collection.

```ruby
@assembly_count = @part.assemblies.size
```

##### `collection.find(...)`

The `collection.find` method finds objects within the collection. It uses the same syntax and options as
[`ActiveRecord::Base.find`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FinderMethods.html#method-i-find).

```ruby
@assembly = @part.assemblies.find(1)
```

##### `collection.where(...)`

The `collection.where` method finds objects within the collection based on the conditions supplied but the objects are loaded lazily meaning that the database is queried only when the object(s) are accessed.

```ruby
@new_assemblies = @part.assemblies.where("created_at > ?", 2.days.ago)
```

##### `collection.exists?(...)`

The `collection.exists?` method checks whether an object meeting the supplied
conditions exists in the collection. It uses the same syntax and options as
[`ActiveRecord::Base.exists?`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FinderMethods.html#method-i-exists-3F).

##### `collection.build(attributes = {})`

The `collection.build` method returns a new object of the associated type. This object will be instantiated from the passed attributes, and the link through the join table will be created, but the associated object will _not_ yet be saved.

```ruby
@assembly = @part.assemblies.build({assembly_name: "Transmission housing"})
```

##### `collection.create(attributes = {})`

The `collection.create` method returns a new object of the associated type. This object will be instantiated from the passed attributes, the link through the join table will be created, and, once it passes all of the validations specified on the associated model, the associated object _will_ be saved.

```ruby
@assembly = @part.assemblies.create({assembly_name: "Transmission housing"})
```

##### `collection.create!(attributes = {})`

Does the same as `collection.create`, but raises `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` if the record is invalid.

##### `collection.reload`

The `collection.reload` method returns a Relation of all of the associated objects, forcing a database read. If there are no associated objects, it returns an empty Relation.

```ruby
@assemblies = @part.assemblies.reload
```

#### Options for `has_and_belongs_to_many`

While Rails uses intelligent defaults that will work well in most situations, there may be times when you want to customize the behavior of the `has_and_belongs_to_many` association reference. Such customizations can easily be accomplished by passing options when you create the association. For example, this association uses two such options:

```ruby
class Parts < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies, -> { readonly },
                                       autosave: true
end
```

The `has_and_belongs_to_many` association supports these options:

* `:association_foreign_key`
* `:autosave`
* `:class_name`
* `:foreign_key`
* `:join_table`
* `:validate`

##### `:association_foreign_key`

By convention, Rails assumes that the column in the join table used to hold the foreign key pointing to the other model is the name of that model with the suffix `_id` added. The `:association_foreign_key` option lets you set the name of the foreign key directly:

TIP: The `:foreign_key` and `:association_foreign_key` options are useful when setting up a many-to-many self-join. For example:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :friends,
      class_name: "User",
      foreign_key: "this_user_id",
      association_foreign_key: "other_user_id"
end
```

##### `:autosave`

If you set the `:autosave` option to `true`, Rails will save any loaded association members and destroy members that are marked for destruction whenever you save the parent object. Setting `:autosave` to `false` is not the same as not setting the `:autosave` option. If the `:autosave` option is not present, then new associated objects will be saved, but updated associated objects will not be saved.

##### `:class_name`

If the name of the other model cannot be derived from the association name, you can use the `:class_name` option to supply the model name. For example, if a part has many assemblies, but the actual name of the model containing assemblies is `Gadget`, you'd set things up this way:

```ruby
class Parts < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies, class_name: "Gadget"
end
```

##### `:foreign_key`

By convention, Rails assumes that the column in the join table used to hold the foreign key pointing to this model is the name of this model with the suffix `_id` added. The `:foreign_key` option lets you set the name of the foreign key directly:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :friends,
      class_name: "User",
      foreign_key: "this_user_id",
      association_foreign_key: "other_user_id"
end
```

##### `:join_table`

If the default name of the join table, based on lexical ordering, is not what you want, you can use the `:join_table` option to override the default.

##### `:validate`

If you set the `:validate` option to `false`, then associated objects will not be validated whenever you save this object. By default, this is `true`: associated objects will be validated when this object is saved.

#### Scopes for `has_and_belongs_to_many`

There may be times when you wish to customize the query used by `has_and_belongs_to_many`. Such customizations can be achieved via a scope block. For example:

```ruby
class Parts < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies, -> { where active: true }
end
```

You can use any of the standard [querying methods](active_record_querying.html) inside the scope block. The following ones are discussed below:

* `where`
* `extending`
* `group`
* `includes`
* `limit`
* `offset`
* `order`
* `readonly`
* `select`
* `distinct`

##### `where`

The `where` method lets you specify the conditions that the associated object must meet.

```ruby
class Parts < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies,
    -> { where "factory = 'Seattle'" }
end
```

You can also set conditions via a hash:

```ruby
class Parts < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies,
    -> { where factory: 'Seattle' }
end
```

If you use a hash-style `where`, then record creation via this association will be automatically scoped using the hash. In this case, using `@parts.assemblies.create` or `@parts.assemblies.build` will create orders where the `factory` column has the value "Seattle".

##### `extending`

The `extending` method specifies a named module to extend the association proxy. Association extensions are discussed in detail [later in this guide](#association-extensions).

##### `group`

The `group` method supplies an attribute name to group the result set by, using a `GROUP BY` clause in the finder SQL.

```ruby
class Parts < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies, -> { group "factory" }
end
```

##### `includes`

You can use the `includes` method to specify second-order associations that should be eager-loaded when this association is used.

##### `limit`

The `limit` method lets you restrict the total number of objects that will be fetched through an association.

```ruby
class Parts < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies,
    -> { order("created_at DESC").limit(50) }
end
```

##### `offset`

The `offset` method lets you specify the starting offset for fetching objects via an association. For example, if you set `offset(11)`, it will skip the first 11 records.

##### `order`

The `order` method dictates the order in which associated objects will be received (in the syntax used by an SQL `ORDER BY` clause).

```ruby
class Parts < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :assemblies,
    -> { order "assembly_name ASC" }
end
```

##### `readonly`

If you use the `readonly` method, then the associated objects will be read-only when retrieved via the association.

##### `select`

The `select` method lets you override the SQL `SELECT` clause that is used to retrieve data about the associated objects. By default, Rails retrieves all columns.

##### `distinct`

Use the `distinct` method to remove duplicates from the collection.

#### When are Objects Saved?

When you assign an object to a `has_and_belongs_to_many` association, that object is automatically saved (in order to update the join table). If you assign multiple objects in one statement, then they are all saved.

If any of these saves fails due to validation errors, then the assignment statement returns `false` and the assignment itself is cancelled.

If the parent object (the one declaring the `has_and_belongs_to_many` association) is unsaved (that is, `new_record?` returns `true`) then the child objects are not saved when they are added. All unsaved members of the association will automatically be saved when the parent is saved.

If you want to assign an object to a `has_and_belongs_to_many` association without saving the object, use the `collection.build` method.

### Association Callbacks

Normal callbacks hook into the life cycle of Active Record objects, allowing you to work with those objects at various points. For example, you can use a `:before_save` callback to cause something to happen just before an object is saved.

Association callbacks are similar to normal callbacks, but they are triggered by events in the life cycle of a collection. There are four available association callbacks:

* `before_add`
* `after_add`
* `before_remove`
* `after_remove`

You define association callbacks by adding options to the association declaration. For example:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, before_add: :check_credit_limit

  def check_credit_limit(book)
    ...
  end
end
```

Rails passes the object being added or removed to the callback.

You can stack callbacks on a single event by passing them as an array:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books,
    before_add: [:check_credit_limit, :calculate_shipping_charges]

  def check_credit_limit(book)
    ...
  end

  def calculate_shipping_charges(book)
    ...
  end
end
```

If a `before_add` callback throws an exception, the object does not get added to the collection. Similarly, if a `before_remove` callback throws an exception, the object does not get removed from the collection.

NOTE: These callbacks are called only when the associated objects are added or removed through the association collection:

```ruby
# Triggers `before_add` callback
author.books << book
author.books = [book, book2]

# Does not trigger the `before_add` callback
book.update(author_id: 1)
```

### Association Extensions

You're not limited to the functionality that Rails automatically builds into association proxy objects. You can also extend these objects through anonymous modules, adding new finders, creators, or other methods. For example:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books do
    def find_by_book_prefix(book_number)
      find_by(category_id: book_number[0..2])
    end
  end
end
```

If you have an extension that should be shared by many associations, you can use a named extension module. For example:

```ruby
module FindRecentExtension
  def find_recent
    where("created_at > ?", 5.days.ago)
  end
end

class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, -> { extending FindRecentExtension }
end

class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :deliveries, -> { extending FindRecentExtension }
end
```

Extensions can refer to the internals of the association proxy using these three attributes of the `proxy_association` accessor:

* `proxy_association.owner` returns the object that the association is a part of.
* `proxy_association.reflection` returns the reflection object that describes the association.
* `proxy_association.target` returns the associated object for `belongs_to` or `has_one`, or the collection of associated objects for `has_many` or `has_and_belongs_to_many`.

Single Table Inheritance
------------------------

Às vezes é desejável compartilhar atributos e comportamento entre _models_.
Vamos dizer que temos _models_ `Car`, `Motorcycle` e `Bicycle`. Queremos
compartilhar os atributos de `color` e `price` e também alguns métodos para
estes atributos, mas ainda mantendo comportamentos específicos para cada um
deles, incluindo _controllers_ separados.

O Rails deixa isso bem fácil. Primeiro, vamos gerar o _model_ de base, `Vehicle`:

```bash
$ rails generate model vehicle type:string color:string price:decimal{10.2}
```

Você notou que estamos adicionando um atributo `type`? Dado que todos os _models_
serão armazenados em uma única tabela, o Rails vai armazenar o nome do _model_
nesse atributo. No nosso exemplo, as possibilidades são `Car`, `Motorcycle` ou
`Bicycle`. STI não funciona sem um atributo `type` na tabela.

Em seguida, vamos gerar os três _models_ que herdam de `Vehicle`. Para isso podemos
usar a opção `--parent=PARENT` que vai gerar um _model_ que herda do "_parent_"
especificado e sem uma _migration_ equivalente (dado que a tabela já existe).

Por exemplo, para gerar o _model_ `Car`:

```bash
$ rails generate model car --parent=Vehicle
```

O _model_ gerado vai parecer com:

```ruby
class Car < Vehicle
end
```

Isso significa que todo o comportamento adicionado à classe `Vehicle` estará
disponível também na classe `Car`, incluindo as associações, métodos públicos,
etc.

Criar um carro vai armazená-lo na tabela `vehicles` e popular o atributo `type`
com o valor "_Car_":

```ruby
Car.create(color: 'Red', price: 10000)
```

vai gerar o seguinte SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO "vehicles" ("type", "color", "price") VALUES ('Car', 'Red', 10000)
```

A _query_ (consulta) por registros de carros vai simplesmente buscar veiculos que
são do tipo _Car_.

```ruby
Car.all
```

vai executar a seguinte _query_:

```sql
SELECT "vehicles".* FROM "vehicles" WHERE "vehicles"."type" IN ('Car')
```
